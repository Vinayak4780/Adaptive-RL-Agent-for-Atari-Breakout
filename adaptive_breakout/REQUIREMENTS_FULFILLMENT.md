# Implementation Requirements Fulfillment

This document outlines how our implementation addresses the specific requirements of the adaptive RL agent for Atari Breakout with dynamic difficulty.

## Core Challenge Requirements

### 1. DQN Agent for Modified Breakout with Dynamic Difficulty Changes

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|---------------|
| Paddle speed randomly varies (50% to 150% of normal speed) | Implemented in `DynamicBreakout._update_difficulty()` and `DynamicBreakout._modify_action()` which varies paddle response based on the speed factor |
| Ball speed occasionally increases mid-episode | Implemented in `DynamicBreakout._update_difficulty()` which has a 20% chance of increasing ball speed at curriculum level 2+ |
| Brick regeneration: some destroyed bricks randomly reappear | Implemented in `DynamicBreakout.step()` with a probability controlled by curriculum level |
| Paddle size changes every 500 frames | Implemented in `DynamicBreakout._update_difficulty()` which changes paddle size at curriculum level 4+ |

### 2. Core Implementation Requirements

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|---------------|
| Build DQN from scratch with experience replay | Implemented in `dqn_agent.py` with both standard `ExperienceReplayBuffer` and `PrioritizedExperienceReplayBuffer` classes |
| Agent must maintain performance despite environmental changes | The `AdaptiveDQNAgent` includes mechanisms to detect and adapt to changes, demonstrated in the analysis of recovery times |
| Implement curriculum learning | The `CurriculumScheduler` in `curriculum.py` manages progressive difficulty increases based on performance thresholds |
| Track and analyze how agent performance degrades/recovers | Implemented in `metrics.py` and `analyze_agent.py` with specific analysis of recovery times and performance across difficulty settings |
| Design a strategy for agent to detect game dynamics shifts | The agent learns environment dynamics embeddings that are used in `detect_environment_change()` method to identify when dynamics have shifted |

### 3. Advanced Twist

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|---------------|
| Agent should recognize patterns in environmental changes | The agent's neural network includes a dynamics embedding layer that learns to represent environment dynamics |
| Predict upcoming difficulty spikes based on game state history | The `dynamics_predictor` layer in the DQN architecture attempts to predict environmental parameters |

## Deliverables

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|---------------|
| Complete DQN implementation with adaptive training | Full implementation in `dqn_agent.py` with adaptive features |
| Performance analysis showing adaptation to dynamic conditions | Analysis scripts in `analyze_agent.py` generate visualizations and metrics of adaptation |
| Gameplay videos demonstrating agent handling different difficulty levels | The `VideoRecorder` class in `metrics.py` captures gameplay at different difficulty levels, saved during training and evaluation |
| Analysis of agent's internal representations during environmental shifts | The `analyze_embeddings()` function in `analyze_agent.py` visualizes how internal representations change with difficulty |
| Discussion on strategies learned vs. failed to learn | Included in the final analysis report generated by `generate_final_report()` in `analyze_agent.py` |
