  - Performance across curriculum levels
  - Adaptation to difficulty transitions
  - Recovery time analysis
  - Visualization of internal representations
  - Performance by difficulty setting

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Environment Modifications
We implemented dynamic difficulty by modifying:
- Action execution (for paddle speed)
- Environment dynamics tracking
- Difficulty parameter management
- Curriculum level integration

### 2. Agent Design
The agent architecture includes:
- Standard DQN components (Q-network, target network, replay buffer)
- Additional network branches for dynamics prediction
- Embedding layers for representation learning
- Mechanisms to detect environmental changes

### 3. Learning Approach
The learning process combines:
- Standard TD learning for Q-values
- Auxiliary tasks for dynamics prediction
- Curriculum learning for progressive difficulty
- Experience prioritization based on TD errors

### 4. Adaptation Mechanisms
The agent adapts through:
- Internal representation learning of environment dynamics
- Detection of environment changes via embedding shifts
- Recovery strategies after difficulty transitions
- Prioritizing experiences related to changing dynamics

## Key Design Choices

1. **CNN Architecture**: We use a standard DQN CNN architecture (3 convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers) with an additional branch for dynamics prediction.

2. **Experience Replay**: We implemented both standard and prioritized experience replay, with prioritization based on TD errors to focus on surprising transitions.

3. **Curriculum Learning**: The automatic curriculum progression uses a combination of reward thresholds and episode counts to determine when to increase difficulty.

4. **Change Detection**: The agent uses its internal representations to detect shifts in environment dynamics, comparing current embeddings with historical patterns.

5. **Recovery Strategy**: The agent implicitly learns recovery strategies through experience replay and value updates, prioritizing experiences where it successfully adapts.

## Performance Evaluation

We evaluate the agent on:

1. **Adaptation Speed**: How quickly the agent recovers after difficulty changes
2. **Performance Robustness**: Maintaining performance across different difficulty settings
3. **Transfer Learning**: Applying strategies learned in one difficulty setting to another
4. **Representation Learning**: Quality of the internal representations for dynamics

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for enhancement:

1. **Meta-Learning**: Incorporating meta-learning approaches to explicitly learn adaptation strategies
2. **Predictive Models**: Adding a forward model to predict environment dynamics changes
3. **Attention Mechanisms**: Using attention to focus on relevant state features during dynamics shifts
4. **Multi-Task Learning**: Training on multiple difficulty levels simultaneously
5. **Policy Distillation**: Distilling knowledge from specialists for different difficulty settings into a single adaptive agent
